gginnards 0.0.1 (2018-06-06)
============================

Methods and functions originally part of 'ggpmisc' but removed in the update
to 'ggpmisc' 0.3.0. The justification for this is that the functions now in
this package do not require packages used in the rest of 'ggpmisc'. As these
methods and fucntions are meant mainly to be used for debugging, having other
packages loaded is unwise.
