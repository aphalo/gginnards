gginnards 0.0.1 (2018-07-05)
============================

Methods and functions originally part of 'ggpmisc' but removed in the update
to 'ggpmisc' 0.3.0 are included in this new package.

* Add new function drop_vars() to automatically drop from the data object
embedded in "gg" "ggplot" objects the variables neither mapped to aesthetics nor
used for faceting.
