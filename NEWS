gginnards 0.0.1 (2018-06-29)
============================

Methods and functions originally part of 'ggpmisc' but removed in the update
to 'ggpmisc' 0.3.0 are included in this new package.
Add new function drop_vars() to automatically drop from the data object embedded
in "gg" objects the variables neither mapped to aesthetics nor used for facetting.
