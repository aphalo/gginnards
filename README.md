Package '**gginnards**' (Explore the innards of 'ggplot2') is a set of
extensions to R package 'ggplot2' (> 2.2.1) useful when learning how to
write extensions and when debugging newly defined stats and geoms.  

A set of functions facilitates the manipulation of layers in ggplot objects,
allowing deletion of any existing layer, insertion of new layers at any
position, and reordering of the existing layers.

Statistics and geometries that echo their data input to the R console and/or 
plot aim at easing debugging during development of new geoms and statistics 
(or learning how ggplot layers work).

Please, see the web site [r4photobiology](http://www.r4photobiology.info) for
details and update notices, and [the docs
site](http://docs.r4photobiology.info/gginnards). Other packages, aimed at easing
photobiology-related calculations including the quantification of biologically
effective radiation in meteorology are available as part of a suite described at
the same website.

The current release of '__gginnards__' is available through
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gginnards) for R (>= 3.3.0).
