Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have a simple question, please don't use this form, but instead ask on <http://stackoverflow.com> using tag [ggpmisc] and possibly [ggplot2].

Please include a minimal reprex. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it or help you find a solution. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page. Do NOT include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.  Please, if at all possible use data that is already available in R or a CRAN package, or simple artificial data generated within your scripts. Include in your reprex the code needed to load data and packages. The example should be as simple as possible and should run on a clean/fresh R session.

Delete these instructions once you have read them.
