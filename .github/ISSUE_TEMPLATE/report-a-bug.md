Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect. If you have an ordinary question, please don't use this form, but instead ask on stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com> using tag [ggpmisc} and optionally [ggoplot2].

Please include a minimal reprex. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page. Do NOT include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.  

Delete these instructions once you have read them.
