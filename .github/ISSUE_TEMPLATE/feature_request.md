Please briefly describe your problem and what new feature you would like to be implemented in future versions. If you have an ordinary question, please don't use this form, but instead ask on stackoverflow <http://stackoverflow.com> using tag [ggpmisc] or possibly [ggplot2].

If possible, please include a minimal example of the desired interface and a sketch of the wished plot output. The goal of an example is to make it as easy as possible for me to understand what you are missing and to make sure that it is not something that is already possible to do in some other way.

Delete these instructions once you have read them.
