## Purpose

Package 'gginnards' (Explore the innards of 'ggplot2') is a set of extensions to
R package 'ggplot2'. Two geometries and two statistics are specially useful when
learning how to write 'ggplot2' extensions and when debugging newly defined
statistics and geometries.

Objects of class `"gg"`, or unrendered ggplot objects, are a list-like structure
containing data and "instructions" to construct a plot and its layers. By
editing this structure it is possible to modify the plot that will be rendered.
Functions are provided for the manipulation of layers within `gg`objects. These
can be useful in the case extensions to 'ggplot2' that define functions that
construct and return whole `gg` objects. In such cases in can be useful to
programatically edit these `gg` objects to insert plot layers or change their
order.

As the variables returned in `data` by many statistics depend on input, some
of these tools can be also useful in everyday plotting with 'gplot2' as a
way of diagnosing problems or getting information that is missing from their
documentation or only available at runtime.

## Stability

Because of its nature, this package does not always play safe and nice even if
it tries to. No exported or internal function or object should be imported or
used in other packages, simply because they may change at any time (as in
version 0.2.0). Although I intend to maintain the package, I will not attempt to
actively keep it compatible with anything but the current version of 'ggplot2',
although it will frequently also work with some earlier versions.
Please, see the blog post [Playing on the same team as your
dependecy](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/09/playing-on-the-same-team-as-your-dependecy/)
by Thomas Lin Pedersen.

## Alternatives

The debug statistics and geoms are defined in 'gginnards' using the same
approach as other 'ggplot2' extensions, without any significant assumptions
about the internals of 'ggplot2'. Thus, they are unlikely to be affected
by minor updates to 'ggplot2'. The layer manipulation functions rely on
the internal structure of `"gg"` objects, but mostly on aspects unlikely
to change frequently.

Package 'gginnards' does not provide a deep view into the structure of `"gg"`
objects or the steps involved in building these objects and rendering them into
graphical objects. Package ['ggtrace'](https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace) by
June Choe provides tools for a much deeper and detailed exploration and edition
of ggplots, but it is much more dependent on the undocumented internals of
'ggplot2' than 'gginnards'. (Note: there exists another package named
[ggtrace](https://github.com/cxli233/ggtraces) for a different purpose. None of
them are yet available through CRAN.)

## History

This package was born when several functions were extracted from package
'ggpmisc' and packaged on their own.

## Geometries

Geometries `geom_debug_panel()` and `geom_debug_droup()` by default print the
`data` object received as input by the draw functi to the console adding a plot
layer that produces no graphic output. As they take as arguments summary
functions, they allows flexibility in how `data` objects are displayed.
`geom_debug_panel()` and `geom_debug_droup()` are useful at any time when one
needs to check what variables are returned by statistics. Many statistics are
well documented and always return the same variables. For other statistics even
if well documented the returned variables in `data` vary depending on grouping
and/or the arguments passed to them, in which case this geometry can also be
useful when debugging scripts.

## Statistics

Statistics `stat_debug_panel()` and `stat_debug_droup()` echo their data input
to the R console aim at easing debugging during development of new geoms and
statistics. They will also help those learning how ggplot grouping, panels and
layers work. As the _debug_ geometries, they take as arguments summary
functions allowing flexibility in how `data` objects are displayed.

For debugging, the value returned by these stats is usually not interesting, and
by default, it is a copy of the `data` object received as input. This can be
changed by passing a function as argument to `fun.data`. This could be useful to
produce data summaries to be plotted as a layer. This may even work as a tool
useful to build ad-hoc statistics with rudimentary built-in debugging.

## Manipulation of layers

A set of functions easy the manipulation of layers in ggplot objects,
allowing deletion of any existing layer, insertion of new layers at any
position, and reordering of the existing layers.

## Manipulation of embedded data

A function to drop unused variables from the data object embedded in `gg` and
`ggplot` objects serves as an additional example of a manipulation that may
be useful when dealing with very large datasets. Companion functions are
defined to explore the embedded `data` object.

## Examples

```{r}
library(gginnards)
```

We print to the R console `data` as _seen_ as input by geometries and statistics.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_debug_panel()
```

We print to the R console `colnames(data)`.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_debug_panel(dbgfun.data = colnames, dbgfun.params = NULL)
```

We print to the R console `data` as returned by `stat_summary()` and _seen_ as
input by geometries.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", geom = "debug_panel")
```

We print to the R console `data` as _seen_ as input by statistics that use a
_panel function_.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_debug_panel()
```

We build object `p` of class `gg` (a ggplot). We query the number of layers and
the position of layers by the class of the `ggproto` object.

```{r}
p <-
  ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", color = "red", size = 2)

  num_layers(p)
  which_layers(p, "GeomPoint")
  which_layers(p, "StatSummary")

  p
  move_layers(p, "GeomPoint", position = "top")
```
