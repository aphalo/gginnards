## Purpose

Package 'gginnards' (Explore the innards of 'ggplot2') is a set of
extensions to R package 'ggplot2' and tools specially useful when learning how
to write extensions and when debugging newly defined stats and geoms.

Occasionally it may be useful to edit `gg` objects. A typical case are packages
that provide extensions to 'ggplot2' that construct and return whole `gg`
objects instead of new statistics and geometries. In such cases in can be
useful to programmaticaly edit these `gg` objects. Functions are provided
for the manipulation of layers within `gg`objects.

As the variables returned in `data` by many statistics depend on input, some
of these tools can be also useful in everyday plotting with `ggplot2`.

## History

This package was born when several functions were removed from package
'ggpmisc'.

## Geometries

`geom_debug()` by default prints the `data` object received as input to the
console and generates no graphic output. As it takes as arguments functions, it
allows great flexibility in how `data` is displayed or saved.
`geom_debug()` is useful at any time when one needs to check what variables are
returned by a statistics. Many statistics are well documented and always return
the same variables. For other statistics even if well documented the returned
variables in `data` vary depending on grouping and/or the arguments passed to
them, in which case this geometry can also be useful when debugging scripts.

## Statistics

Statistics that echo their data input to the R console and/or
plot aim at easing debugging during development of new geoms and statistics.
The should help those learning how ggplot layers work.

## Manipulation of layers

A set of functions layestates the manipulation of layers in ggplot objects,
allowing deletion of any existing layer, insertion of new layers at any
position, and reordering of the existing layers.

## Manipulation of embedded data

A function to drop unused variables from the data object embedded in `gg` and
`ggplot` objects serves as an additional example of a manipulation that may
be useful when dealing with very large datasets. Companion functions are
defined to explore the embedded data.

## Examples

```{r}
library(gginnards)
```

We print to the R console `data` as _seen_ as input by geometries and statistics.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_debug()
```

We print to the R console `colnames(data)`.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_debug(summary.fun = colnames)
```

We print to the R console `data` as returned by `stat_summary()` and _seen_ as input by geometries.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", geom = "debug")
```

We print to the R console `data` as _seen_ as input by statistics that use a
_panel function_.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  stat_debug_panel()
```

We build object `p` of class `gg` (a ggplot). We query the number of layers and
the position of layers by the class of the `ggproto` object.

```{r}
p <-
  ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", color = "red", size = 2)

  num_layers(p)
  which_layers(p, "GeomPoint")
  which_layers(p, "StatSummary")

  p
  move_layers(p, "GeomPoint", position = "top")
```
