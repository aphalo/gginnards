## Purpose

Package 'gginnards' (Explore the innards of 'ggplot2') is a set of extensions to
R package 'ggplot2'. Two geometries and two statistics are specially useful when
learning how to write 'ggplot2' extensions and when debugging newly defined
statistics and geometries.

**Note:** _ggplots_ were stored as objects of class `"gg"` with a list-like structure
in 'ggplot2' (< 4.0.0 ). In 'ggplot2' (>= 4.0.0) _ggplots_ are stored as `S7`
objects of class `"ggplot2:ggplot"`. 

_ggplots_ objects of these two classes contain both data and 
"instructions" to construct a plot and its layers. By
editing these objects it is possible to modify or edit a ggplot in advance of rendering.
Functions are provided for the manipulation of layers within _ggplot_ objects. These
can be useful in the case of extensions to 'ggplot2' that define functions that
construct and return whole _ggplot_ objects. In such cases in can be useful to
programatically edit these _ggplot_ objects to insert plot layers or change their
order.

As the variables returned in `data` by many statistics depend on input, some
of these tools can be also useful in everyday plotting with 'gplot2' as a
way of diagnosing problems or getting information that is missing from their
documentation or only available at runtime.

## Stability

Because of its nature, this package does not always play safe and nice even if
it tries to. No exported or internal function or object should be imported or
used in other packages, simply because they may change at any time (as in
version 0.2.0). Although I intend to maintain the package, I will not attempt to
actively keep it compatible with anything but the current version of 'ggplot2',
although it will frequently also work with some earlier versions.
Please, see the blog post [Playing on the same team as your
dependecy](https://tidyverse.org/blog/2022/09/playing-on-the-same-team-as-your-dependecy/)
by Thomas Lin Pedersen.

To my surprise, and thanks to the care taken by the developers of 'ggplot2',
in spite of the overhaul of the class system in 'ggplot2' (== 4.0.0), no
changes were necessary to keep 'gginnards' compatible with the updated
'ggplot2'! A huge thanks you to Teun van den Brand, Thomas Lin Pedersen and the
rest of the 'ggplot2' team.

## Alternatives

The debug statistics and geoms are defined in 'gginnards' using the same
approach as other 'ggplot2' extensions, without any significant assumptions
about the internals of 'ggplot2'. Thus, they have not been affected
by minor, and even major, updates to 'ggplot2'. The layer manipulation functions rely on
the internal structure of `"gg"` objects, but mostly on aspects unlikely
to change frequently.

Package 'gginnards' does not provide a deep view into the structure of _ggplot_
objects or the steps involved in building these objects and rendering them into
graphical objects. Package ['ggtrace'](https://yjunechoe.github.io/ggtrace/) by
June Choe provides tools for a much deeper and detailed exploration and edition
of ggplots, but it is much more dependent on the undocumented internals of
'ggplot2' than 'gginnards'. (Note: there exists another package named
[ggtrace](https://github.com/cxli233/ggtraces) for a different purpose,
available through CRAN.)

## History

This package was born when several functions were extracted from package
'ggpmisc' and packaged on their own.

## Geometries

Geometries `geom_debug_panel()` and `geom_debug_group()` by default print the
`data` object received as input by the draw function to the console adding a plot
layer that produces no graphic output. As they take as arguments summary
functions, they allows flexibility in how `data` objects are displayed.
`geom_debug_panel()` and `geom_debug_group()` are useful at any time when one
needs to check what variables are returned by statistics. Many statistics are
well documented and always return the same variables. For other statistics even
if well documented the returned variables in `data` vary depending on grouping
and/or the arguments passed to them, in which case this geometry can also be
useful for debugging data-visualization scripts.

## Statistics

Statistics `stat_debug_panel()` and `stat_debug_group()`, which echo their data
input to the R console, aim at easing debugging during development of new geoms
and statistics. They will also help those learning how ggplot grouping, panels
and layers work. As the _debug_ geometries, they take as arguments summary
functions allowing flexibility in how `data` objects are displayed.

For debugging, the value returned by these stats is usually not interesting, and
by default, it is a copy of the `data` object received as input. This can be
changed by passing a function as argument to `fun.data`. This could be useful to
produce data summaries to be plotted as a layer. This may even work as a tool
useful to build ad-hoc statistics with rudimentary built-in debugging.

## Manipulation of layers

A set of functions easy the manipulation of layers in ggplot objects,
allowing deletion of any existing layer, insertion of new layers at any
position, and reordering of the existing layers.

## Manipulation of embedded data

A function to drop unused variables from the data object embedded in _ggplot_
objects serves as an additional example of a manipulation that may be useful
when dealing with very large datasets. Companion functions are defined to
explore the embedded `data` object.

## Inspection of themes

Functions are provided to compare themes and to inspect them. In 'ggplot2'
(>= 4.0.0) themes have adquired additional fields. These functions can be
used both to debug newly created or modified themes and to learn how themes
work. The functions are quite general, and should work across 'ggplot2'
versions.

## Examples

```{r}
library(gginnards)
```

We print to the R console `data` as _seen_ as input by geometries and statistics.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_debug_panel()
```

We print to the R console `colnames(data)`.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, color = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_debug_panel(dbgfun.data = colnames, dbgfun.params = NULL)
```

We print to the R console `data` as returned by `stat_summary()` and _seen_ as
input by geometries.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", geom = "debug_panel")
```

We print to the R console `data` as _seen_ as input by statistics that use a
_panel function_.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) +
  stat_debug_panel()
```

We build a _ggplot_ object `p`. We query the number of layers and
the position of layers by the class of the `ggproto` object.

```{r}
p <-
  ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_cl_boot", color = "red", size = 2)

  num_layers(p)
  which_layers(p, "GeomPoint")
  which_layers(p, "StatSummary")

  p
  move_layers(p, "GeomPoint", position = "top")
```
