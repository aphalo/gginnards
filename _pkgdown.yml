  - title: Package overview
    contents:
    - '`gginnards-package`'
  - title: Geoms
    desc: Geoms, short for geometric objects, generate output from data. Contrary to "normal" geoms, these geoms do not render data as graphical elements.
    contents:
    - geom_debug
    - geom_null
  - title: Statistics
    desc: It is often useful to summarize data before plotting. Contrary to "normal" statistics, the data summaries these statistics return are aimed at debugging.
    contents:
    - stat_debug_group
    - stat_debug_panel
  - title: Manipulation of layers
    desc: Occasionaly it can be useful to edit `gg` objects _breaking_ the usual rules of the _grammar of graphics_ operations such as delete, insert, extract and modify stacking order of layers.
    contents:
    - delete_layers
  - title: Manipulation of embedded data
    desc: Automatically delete unused variables, extract attributes, and identify which variables in data are mapped to aestheics or used in a plot.
    contents:
    - drop_vars
  - title: Explore the innards of objects.
    desc: Specialization of `str()`. This function complements the `summary()` method from 'ggplot2'.
